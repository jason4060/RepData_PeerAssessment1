## Loading and preprocessing the data
activity <- read_csv("~/Downloads/activity.csv")


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
library(dplyr)

# Group by date and calculate the sum of steps for each date
sum_steps_per_date <- data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

print(sum_steps_per_date)


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate the average number of steps for each 5-minute interval
average_pattern <- activity  %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Make a time series plot

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
# Assuming you have a data frame named df with columns 'date' and 'steps' (with filled-in missing values)

# Sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  date = rep(seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2023-01-10"), by = "days"), each = 5),
  steps = c(100, 150, 120, 200, NA, 80, 90, 110, 130, 170, 50, 60, 70, 90, 110)
)

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Convert 'date' to Date class
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)

# Create a new factor variable indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day
activity <- activity %>%
  mutate(day_type = ifelse(weekdays(date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday"))

# Group by both interval and day_type, and calculate the average number of steps
average_pattern <- activity %>%
  group_by(interval, day_type) %>%
  summarize(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Make a panel plot
ggplot(average_pattern, aes(x = interval, y = average_steps, group = day_type, color = day_type)) +
  geom_line(type = "l") +
  labs(title = "Activity Patterns - Weekdays vs. Weekends",
       x = "5-Minute Interval",
       y = "Average Number of Steps",
       color = "Day Type") +
  facet_wrap(~day_type, scales = "free_y")
